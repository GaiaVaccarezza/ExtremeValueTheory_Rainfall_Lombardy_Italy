 The results are very satisfactory. The introduction of covariates leads to more realistic predictions and to a quantitative understanding of the effects of the atmospheric agents in the region, which agrees with the theory. 
Furthermore, the deviation of the prediction of the kriging model from the test data is on average around 2 or 3 mm which is very positive. 
A more detailed description of the results will be provided after my Graduation.
